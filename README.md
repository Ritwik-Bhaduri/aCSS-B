## Simulation Workflow Instructions
This document provides instructions for running simulations in a SLURM-enabled environment. SLURM is required to execute the following commands as they use job scheduling and parallelization features. For users without SLURM, one can simply run the corresponding Run.R files in a loop with appropriate seeds. 

### Simulation 1: Logistic Regression


### Simulation 2: Mixture of Gaussians


### Simulation 3-5: Group sparsity, Rank one matrix, Linear Spline
